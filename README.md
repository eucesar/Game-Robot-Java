> üå±üë®‚Äçüíª - Game Theme: RoboCup - FIAP

Sprint 1 - This program is a game where the player has to guide a robot to reach a trophy on a map that I drew 'mapa.png' (this image is inside the directory), providing the direction and the number of steps to be covered data taken taken. The program displays instructions for the game, requests input from the player, and verifies that the inputs are valid. If the entries are valid, the program verifies that the player's entries are correct for each step of the robot's movement towards the trophy (Direction and Steps). If the player makes a mistake, the game ends with a "GAMER-OVER" message, and if the player wins the trophy, the game ends with a congratulations message. SPRINT GRADE - 10

Sprint 2 - I carried out a continuation of sprint 1 (fiap) of Java, I put a repeat loop when the player loses, going back in which direction and steps he was, every time the user makes a mistake. (instead of going back to the beginning of the loop). When the user wins, the game asks if the user wants to continue playing or if he wants to stop playing (Y/N). I put the Robot's Battery in the jobo, at each step it loses battery, if it tells the wrong direction or steps loses battery and etc. (makes the game more dynamic) - follows the same logic as sprint 1, but in a real game format with a repeating loop.

Sprint 3 - This system that I developed for Sprint 3 at FIAP has the theme 'Develop a program in Java language to rank the teams participating in RoboCup'. RoboCup is a tournament that students of the Information Systems Course will have at the end of our 1st Year. In this code, a Java program was developed to manage a ranking of teams participating in RoboCup. The user starts by entering the number of teams and then provides information about each team, including their number, amount of matches, and design grade. The code calculates each team's score based on the results of the fights (wins and draws) and the design score. It then ranks the teams in descending order of scores, with ties broken using the design score in case of ties. The code also identifies and displays teams that tied in number of fights and design score. Upon completion, the user has the option to restart the program or terminate it. These features make the code an interactive and flexible team classification system.
