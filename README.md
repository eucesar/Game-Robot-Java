> 🌱👨‍💻 - This program is a simple game where the player has to guide a robot to reach a trophy on a map that I drew 'mapa.png' (this image is inside the directory), providing the direction and the number of steps to be taken. The program presents an introduction and instructions for the game, prompts the player for input, and checks that the inputs are valid. If the entries are valid, the program verifies that the player's entries are correct for each step of the robot's movement towards the trophy. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends with a "GAMER-OVER" message, and if the player wins the trophy, the game ends with a congratulations message.
